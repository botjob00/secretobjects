   IN this Assignment we have built a collection of images base on one significant property wich is common in all of these objects wich is thier color black 
   Black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light. 
   It is an achromatic color, a color without hue, like white and gray. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness.
  Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. 
  Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, 
   and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.

They were never given a formal name and were referred to variously as "iPod headphones"[1] and "the iPod's earbud-style headphones".[2] They were bundled with two pairs of foam covers.[3] The second generation added a plastic slider to allow the user to limit the gap between the wires. The third generation were redesigned with a slightly longer strain relief, a slightly smaller speaker grill, and the left/right marking being moved from the outside to the inside.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I call <a href="#">Madison, Wisconsin</a> my home, the land of dairy (Get outta here, California!). My favorite part about <b>Madison</b> is that we're a city built around a large university. There's a vibrant crowd here that keeps this city bold and <strong>progressive</strong>. 
    
    The isles of <a href="#">cheese</a> in every grocery store aren't so bad either.
      
    <p>You can find me in the city, <strong>camera</strong> in hand, documenting the stories around me, or in little cafe's writing about my daily adventures and the people I meet.</p>
